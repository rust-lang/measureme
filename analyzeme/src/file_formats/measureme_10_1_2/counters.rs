//! Profiling counters and their implementation.

//!
//! Name (for [`Counter::by_name()`]) | Counter                      | OSes  | CPUs
//! --------------------------------- | -------                      | ----  | ----
//! `wall-time`                       | [`WallTime`]                 | any   | any
//! `instructions:u`                  | [`Instructions`]             | Linux | `x86_64`
//! `instructions-minus-irqs:u`       | [`InstructionsMinusIrqs`]    | Linux | `x86_64`<br>- AMD (since K8)<br>- Intel (since Sandy Bridge)
//! `instructions-minus-r0420:u`      | [`InstructionsMinusRaw0420`] | Linux | `x86_64`<br>- AMD (Zen)
//!
//! *Note: `:u` suffixes for hardware performance counters come from the Linux `perf`
//! tool, and indicate that the counter is only active while userspace code executes
//! (i.e. it's paused while the kernel handles syscalls, interrupts, etc.).*
//!
//! # Limitations and caveats
//!
//! *Note: for more information, also see the GitHub PR which first implemented hardware
//! performance counter support ([#143](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/143)).*
//!
//! The hardware performance counters (i.e. all counters other than `wall-time`) are limited to:
//! * Linux, for out-of-the-box performance counter reads from userspace
//!   * other OSes could work through custom kernel extensions/drivers, in the future
//! * `x86_64` CPUs, mostly due to lack of other available test hardware
//!   * new architectures would be easier to support (on Linux) than new OSes
//!   * easiest to add would be 32-bit `x86` (aka `i686`), which would reuse
//!     most of the `x86_64` CPU model detection logic
//! * specific (newer) CPU models, for certain non-standard counters
//!   * e.g. `instructions-minus-irqs:u` requires a "hardware interrupts" (aka "IRQs")
//!     counter, which is implemented differently between vendors / models (if at all)
//! * single-threaded programs (counters only work on the thread they were created on)
//!   * for profiling `rustc`, this means only "check mode" (`--emit=metadata`),
//!     is supported currently (`-Z no-llvm-threads` could also work)
//!   * unclear what the best approach for handling multiple threads would be
//!   * changing the API (e.g. to require per-thread profiler handles) could result
//!     in a more efficient implementation, but would also be less ergonomic
//!   * profiling data from multithreaded programs would be harder to use due to
//!     noise from synchronization mechanisms, non-deterministic work-stealing, etc.
//!
//! For ergonomic reasons, the public API doesn't vary based on `features` or target.
//! Instead, attempting to create any unsupported counter will return `Err`, just
//! like it does for any issue detected at runtime (e.g. incompatible CPU model).
//!
//! When counting instructions specifically, these factors will impact the profiling quality:
//! * high-level non-determinism (e.g. user interactions, networking)
//!   * the ideal use-case is a mostly-deterministic program, e.g. a compiler like `rustc`
//!   * if I/O can be isolated to separate profiling events, and doesn't impact
//!     execution in a more subtle way (see below), the deterministic parts of
//!     the program can still be profiled with high accuracy
//!   * intentional uses of randomness may change execution paths, though for
//!     cryptographic operations specifically, "constant time" implementations
//!     are preferred / necessary (in order to limit an external observer's
//!     ability to infer secrets), so they're not as much of a problem
//!   * even otherwise-deterministic machine-local communication (to e.g. system
//!     services or drivers) can behave unpredictably (especially under load)
//!     * while we haven't observed this in the wild yet, it's possible for
//!       file reads/writes to be split up into multiple smaller chunks
//!       (and therefore take more userspace instructions to fully read/write)
//! * low-level non-determinism (e.g. ASLR, randomized `HashMap`s, timers)
//!   * ASLR ("Address Space Layout Randomization"), may be provided by the OS for
//!     security reasons, or accidentally caused through allocations that depend on
//!     random data (even as low-entropy as e.g. the base 10 length of a process ID)
//!   * on Linux ASLR can be disabled by running the process under `setarch -R`
//!   * this impacts `rustc` and LLVM, which rely on keying `HashMap`s by addresses
//!     (typically of interned data) as an optimization, and while non-determinstic
//!     outputs are considered bugs, the instructions executed can still vary a lot,
//!     even when the externally observable behavior is perfectly repeatable
//!   * `HashMap`s are involved in one more than one way:
//!     * both the executed instructions, and the shape of the allocations depend
//!       on both the hasher state and choice of keys (as the buckets are in
//!       a flat array indexed by some of the lower bits of the key hashes)
//!     * so every `HashMap` with keys being/containing addresses will amplify
//!       ASLR and ASLR-like effects, making the entire program more sensitive
//!     * the default hasher is randomized, and while `rustc` doesn't use it,
//!       proc macros can (and will), and it's harder to disable than Linux ASLR
//!   * most ways of measuring time will inherently never perfectly align with
//!     exact points in the program's execution, making time behave like another
//!     low-entropy source of randomness - this also means timers will elapse at
//!     unpredictable points (which can further impact the rest of the execution)
//!     * this includes the common thread scheduler technique of preempting the
//!       currently executing thread with a periodic timer interrupt, so the exact
//!       interleaving of multiple threads will likely not be reproducible without
//!       special OS configuration, or tools that emulate a deterministic scheduler
//!     * `jemalloc` (the allocator used by `rustc`, at least in official releases)
//!       has a 10 second "purge timer", which can introduce an ASLR-like effect,
//!       unless disabled with `MALLOC_CONF=dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`
//! * hardware flaws (whether in the design or implementation)
//!   * hardware interrupts ("IRQs") and exceptions (like page faults) cause
//!     overcounting (1 instruction per interrupt, possibly the `iret` from the
//!     kernel handler back to the interrupted userspace program)
//!     * this is the reason why `instructions-minus-irqs:u` should be preferred
//!       to `instructions:u`, where the former is available
//!     * there are system-wide options (e.g. `CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL`) for removing
//!       some interrupts from the cores used for profiling, but they're not as
//!       complete of a solution, nor easy to set up in the first place
//!   * AMD Zen CPUs have a speculative execution feature (dubbed `SpecLockMap`),
//!     which can cause non-deterministic overcounting for instructions following
//!     an atomic instruction (such as found in heap allocators, or `measureme`)
//!     * this is automatically detected, with a `log` message pointing the user
//!       to <https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Zen> for guidance on how to
//!       disable `SpecLockMap` on their system (sadly requires root access)
//!
//! Even if some of the above caveats apply for some profiling setup, as long as
//! the counters function, they can still be used, and compared with `wall-time`.
//! Chances are, they will still have less variance, as everything that impacts
//! instruction counts will also impact any time measurements.
//!
//! Also keep in mind that instruction counts do not properly reflect all kinds
//! of workloads, e.g. SIMD throughput and cache locality are unaccounted for.
